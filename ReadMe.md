# SnakeBite Game
Made by Kumar Shivanshu


SnakeBite is a very easy and graphically interactive game made using C++ and SFML(Simple and fast multimedia library). It is keyboard based game, can be played using only keyboard. SnakeBite is the first game I ever made, so learnt many new things earlier wans't knowing. Here I learnt the apllication of classes and objects. 

**Snake Game-**Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions for many platforms.

### Aim of making the project
* To clear the understanding of how such game works.
* To learn graphics designing using SFML.
* To make use of my skills in c++.
* To see how Class and Objects are useful.

### Languages Used
* C++ - C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
* SFML - Simple and Fast Multimedia Library is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide a simple application programming interface to various multimedia components in computers. It is written in C++ with bindings available for C, Crystal, D, Euphoria, Go, Java, Julia,.NET, Nim, OCaml, Python, Ruby, and Rust.


### Data Structures Used
 * Linked List
 * Maps
 * Array

### Keyboard Controls
 * Up Arrow Key - To go up
 * Down Arrow Key - To go down
 * Left Arrow Key - To go left
 * Right Arrow Key - To go right
 * Space Button - To pause/resume the game
 * Enter Key - To select the highlighted text

## How to use this
* ### Prerequisites 
   1. C++ Environment
   2. SFML Library
   3. Visual Studio
* ### Steps to follow to run it using VSCode Editor
   [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d0aYD0fWlE&list=PLiZZKL9HLmWMF8PlzvZu2WOC9kjs1zzhm&index=4&t=2s)
* ### Use exe file
   You can also run the application using the .exe file located in Debug folder with name tictactoe.exe
   But first you need to clone/download the whole project to your computer (**Note-** While using .exe it should only be used inside Debug folder where all .dll files are kept and Assets folder should also be in same folder because Assets are grabbed during run time, it isn't included in .exe file)

## Possible Future Update
* Show latest highest score scored 
* Add sound when game starts/ends and when snake the eats the food
* Add difficulty level
* Add levels for the game
* Change the speed of the snake with time
